      <p class="center">Episode TBD<br />RETURN OF THE JESP</p>
      <p>It is a period of vendor war.</p>
      <p>The Jedi Knight known only as JESP has been summoned back from self-imposed exile by the FIRST ORDER.</p>
      <p>After vanishing without a trace, JESP was secretly captured by the sinister GURULAB.</p>
      <p>The once-promising Jedi has now escaped and returned to his home planet of BROWSKIS.</p>
      <p>There, alongside the fierce Jedi Knights VDAO and ELS, young JESP must once again board the Milliliter FALCON Tube, a vessel fully equipped for the mission ahead.</p>
      <p>But JESP has no plan, no understanding of the objective, and confuses hyperspace with emotional growth.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, Senator TUKA, obsessed with locating JESP, has dispatched thousands of remote probes into the far reaches of space to uncover his ignorance.</p>
      <p>Unaware of the trials to come, JESP must now UNLEARN all that he once tried to learn.</p>
      <p>The fate of the galaxy may hang in the balance… but mostly, everyone just wants to know how he made it this far.</p>
